COMP3104 Devops is looking at "a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly changing resilient systems at scale." - Jez Humble

Our course has ten quizes (best eight out of ten), two lab exercises (best eight out of ten), two assignments, a midterm, and a final exam.  
There is one class every week.  Each class is three hours long.

Some of the topics we learned in this course so far are Git commands and how to use github.  
Single paged applications as well.  

The second half of the course will look at working with cloud infrastructure, automating devops & quality assurance,
devops assembly lines, commonly used devops tech exposed, and transitioning into the role of devops.
