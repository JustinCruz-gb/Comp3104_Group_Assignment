The DevOps course is designed to better prepare us to enter the IT field.  We will learn about various programs including Amazon Web Services, Ansible, Docker, GitHub and Travis CI.  Using DevOps practices effectively will allow for a process predicated on ease to ship code to Production servers, apply hot-fixes, catch errors before they produce some sort of unintended behaviour and keep transparency & communication heightened across all teams.
