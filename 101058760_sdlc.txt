Devops is important to learn because it allows businesses to deliver applications at a faster rate and results in fewer redundancies since it brings together development and operations teams.

Devops has a set of processes that can drastically reduce IT overhead, enforce the best security practices, and remove manual tasks.
Moreover, improves communication across teams.

Due to shorter development cycles devops promotes frequent code versions.  
This makes it easy to find problems in the code.
